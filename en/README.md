# Programming Research Algorithms Course
## Ariel University, School of Computer Science 

This course will show you how to connect the world of theoretic research in computer science, with the world of practical programming. By the end of the course, you will know how to:

* Read a research-level paper describing a new algorithm;
* Understand the operation of the algorithm and its advantages over existing algorithms;
* Program the algorithm in Python.

These abilities will help you whether you decide to work in the industry or in academy:

* In the software industry, the ability to understand a research paper will enable you to keep pace with recent innovations, and apply them in your work.
* In academy, the ability to program a research algorithm will enable you to write simulations and conduct comparative studies between algorithms.
