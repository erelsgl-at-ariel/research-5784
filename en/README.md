# Programming Research Algorithms Course
## Ariel University, School of Computer Science

## Course goals 

The course aims to connect the world of theoretic research in computer science, with the world of practical programming. During the course, you will choose a research-level paper containing new algorithms, program the algorithms in Python, and integrate them into an appropriate open-source library. By the end of the course, you will know how to:

* Learn a new algorithm published in a recent research paper;
* Construct running examples for understanding the operation of the algorithm;
* Program the algorithm in Python;
* Thoroughy test your implementation;
* Measure and improve the performance of your algorithm;
* Create a simple website for deomnstrating your algorithm;
* Publish the algorithm in an open-source library.

These abilities will help you whether you decide to work in the industry or in academy:

* In the software industry, the ability to understand a research paper will enable you to keep pace with recent innovations, and apply them in your work.
* In academy, the ability to program a research algorithm will enable you to write simulations and conduct comparative studies between algorithms.

## Target audience

The course is intended for 3rd-year undergraduate students in computer science, as well as graduate students of all levels.

To succeed in the course, you should have profound knowledge in both programming and algorithms. The course is recommended for students who received high grades in both programming courses and algorithm courses in their first two years.
