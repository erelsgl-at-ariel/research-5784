# Programming Research Algorithms Course
## Ariel University, School of Computer Science

## Course goals 

The course aims to show you how to connect the world of theoretic research in computer science, with the world of practical programming. By the end of the course, you will know how to:

* Read a research-level paper describing a new algorithm;
* Understand the operation of the algorithm and its advantages over existing algorithms;
* Program the algorithm in Python;
* Publish the algorithm in an open-source library.

These abilities will help you whether you decide to work in the industry or in academy:

* In the software industry, the ability to understand a research paper will enable you to keep pace with recent innovations, and apply them in your work.
* In academy, the ability to program a research algorithm will enable you to write simulations and conduct comparative studies between algorithms.

## Target audience

The course is intended for 3rd-year undergraduate students in computer science, as well as graduate students of all levels.

To succeed in the course, you should have profound knowledge in both programming and algorithms. The course is recommended for students who received high grades in both programming courses and algorithm courses in their first two years.
